# Red-Team-vs.-Blue-Team

In this project we had two teams Red vs. Blue playing the role of both a Pentester and SOC Analyst
The Red Team, attacked a vulnerable Virtual Machine (VM) within the network environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine
The Blue Team, you used Kibana to review logs taken during the attacked performed by the Red Team
The team extracted hard data and visualizations logs to create a report.
Lastly, with the data extracted the team interpreted the log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit successfully performed

### Some of the tools used during the project were:
- Firefox
- Hydra
- Nmap
- John the Ripper
- Metasploit
- curl
- MSVenom

The attack took place using a virtual Kali Linux Machine
